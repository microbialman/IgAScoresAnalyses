## IgAScores Analyses

This repository contains all code associated with the analyses presented in the IgA-Seq methods paper [here](add link to paper).

Each Rmd file can be run individually to recreate the analyses within the paper. All associated data is included via objects/functions in the associated [IgAScores](https://github.com/microbialman/IgAScores) package, with the exception of the input files for the replication dataset (Huus_Analyses.Rmd) that are associated with that [manuscript](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2020.03.012).

The main functions used to calculate IgA scores throughout the study (and all code for simulations) can be found in the [IgAScores](https://github.com/microbialman/IgAScores) R package.
